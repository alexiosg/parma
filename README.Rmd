# parma
The **p**ortfolio **a**llocation and **r**isk **m**anagament **a**pplications (**parma**) 
package contains a unique set of methods and models for the optimal allocation of capital in 
financial portfolios. It uniquely represents certain discontinuous problems using their 
smooth approximation counterparts and implements fractional based programming for the 
direct optimization of risk-to-reward ratios. In combination with the 
[rmgarch](https://github.com/alexiosg/rmgarch) package, it enables the confident 
solution to scenario based optimization problems using such risk and deviation 
measures as Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD), Variance (EV), Minimax, Conditional 
Value at Risk (CVaR), Conditional Drawdown at Risk (CDaR) and Lower Partial 
Moments (LPM). In addition, it implements moment based optimization for use with 
the quadratic EV problem, and a higher moment CARA utility expansion using the 
coskewness and cokurtosis matrices generated from the GO-GARCH with affine GH or 
NIG distributions. Benchmark relative optimization (tracking error) is also 
implemented as are basic mixed integer cardinality constraints. Finally, for 
non-convex problem formulations such as the upper to lower partial moments 
function, global optimization methods using a penalty based method are available.

The stable version is on CRAN.
