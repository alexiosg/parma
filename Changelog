	* DESCRIPTION (Version): version is 1.5-3
	* Bernhard copied the socp solver from FRAPO (which removed it)
	to parma to allow compatibility while we work on porting to the
	new cccp solver.

2015-07-02  Alexios Ghalanos <alexios@4dscape.com>
	* DESCRIPTION (Version): version is 1.5-2.
	* Fixed bug in QP spec where the targetType equality was
	not respected.
	* Fixes to pass new CRAN checks which only attach base.

	* DESCRIPTION (Version): version is 1.5-1.
	* Fixed bug in QP spec where the eq.mat custom equality
	constraint was not passed to the solver. [AG]
	* New socp type problems and formulations and use of Socp
	solver from FRAPO. Updated vignette entry with details. [AG]
	* New tests in parma.tests for socp problems. [AG]
	* Replaced dependency on timeSeries for dataset with xts. [AG]
	* Removed Daily2Weekly and Daily2Monthly functions since xts can
	easily be used to create these without additional functionality. [AG]
	* Moved nloptr to Depends since there were problems with the pure
	import of the main solver function without loading package in user space. [AG]
	* Some more fixes to pass latest CRAN tests. [AG]

	* DESCRIPTION (Version): version is 1.5-0.
	* Exported and documented custom constraint functions and their jacobians 
	for use with the NLP problems (minrisk and fractional), including turnover 
	constraint (simple, and buy/sell), and a portfolio variance target 
	constraint.
	* Vignette now built using sweave.

	* DESCRIPTION (Version): version is 1.03.
	* Streamlining/re-write of all methods and functions.
	* Addition of frontier function.
	* Removal of scenario generation functions and rmgarch dependence (moved
	to rmgarch).
	* Fixes to some NLP functions.
	* Numerous tests, examples added to inst folder.
	* Release to CRAN.
	
2012-06-20  Alexios Ghalanos <alexios@4dscape.com>
	* DESCRIPTION (Version): version is 1.02.
	* Removed global solvers which had poor performance.
	* Created and exported a direct translation into R of the cmaes 
	solver of Hansen from his matlab version 3.6 code with many options.
	* Some cleanup in the GNLP problems and more tests added in inst folder.

2012-06-15  Alexios Ghalanos <alexios@4dscape.com>
	* DESCRIPTION (Version): version is 1.01.
	* Added parmaset<- and parmaget access methods on the parmaSpec object.
	* Renamed old parmaget function for loading previously saved scenario or 
	moments from file to parmaload.
	* Added GNLP solvers for cardinality constraints in NLP and for the
	LPMUPM problem formulation.
	* Added MILP for the minrisk LP problems with cardinality constraints.
