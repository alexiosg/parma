	presented by Konno and Yamazaki (1991). In their paper, it was claimed
	that (under the assumption that there is no upper limit on the investment
	in an asset) the number of nonzero assets in the optimal portfolio
	is at most 2T + 2, where T is the number of time periods in the data
	base used to approximate the parameters of the return distributions
	of the assets. The formulation we present, which is shown to be equivalent
	to that of Konno and Yamazaki, has a bound of T + 2 on the number
	of nonzero assets in the optimal portfolio.},

	can be used, virtually unchanged, for long-short portfolio optimization--provided
